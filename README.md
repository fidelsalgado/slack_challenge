## Instructions
To install all the dependencies you need to run two commands and you need to 
have [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [bower](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bower) installed:
```bash
$ bower install
$ npm install
```

To run the server you'll need [grunt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-cli). Then you can simply
run the following command:
```bash
$ grunt serve
```
When the server is running you can run the app by clicking [this link](http://localhost:9000/scrape).
